# EzTunes
A guitar tuning native Android application developed as a college project.

The user can tune their stringed instrument by matching the sound of live recorded and midi generated notes against their own,
given the freedom to change tunings or pick the specific note they need.  

EzTunes also features an equaliser with graphic visualisation, allowing the user to choose one of 5 songs and change the frequency
levels based on 8 different genre's to see how the output sound is affected (eg. Jazz, Metal, Pop)

The user can play around with a frequency slider on the main menu of this application for entertainment purposes.
